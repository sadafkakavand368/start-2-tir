My first python project for learning basics
-------
## project: to-do-list.py
this is a very basic python program where the user can:
- Enter 3 tasks
- Mark one of them as done
- See which one is done with (*) and others with ()

This project helped me practice:
- "input()", "print()"
- Basic variables
- If/else expressions

File: [to-do-list.py](./to-do-list.py)
